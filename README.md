### CPSC 120

* Lab 3  
  The First lab that in enjoyed was Lab 3 was my favorite because I got to create a program that calculates BMR for both men and women. I learned how to write functions, handle user input, format output, and debug my code effectively.

* Lab 6  
  Lab 6 was a favorite because I learned to use if statements and vectors in C++. I also practiced using command line arguments and compiling with make. It helped me understand program flow and working with a partner.

* Lab 5 
 Lab 5 involved creating a program to calculate the area of a triangle. I learned how to collect user input, apply the correct formula, write functions, and ensure the program handles different types of inputs correctly.
